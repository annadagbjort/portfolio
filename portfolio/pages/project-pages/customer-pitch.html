            <p> In this part project we pitched our Foodsharing cph campaign website with the video we made. Our pitch was about “Getting people to value their food”<br>
                I talked about “the how”, how we wanted to get people to value their food.<br>
                It was an exciting new experience to get the opportunity to pitch for a client for the first time.

            <div class="thin-box orange"></div>
            <h3>What I said in the pitch:</h3>
            <p> How we want get people to value their food? </p>
            <p>
                By empowering people to take control of their behaviours around food waste through education. Wanting to stop wasting your food can seem overwhelming since of course like we know, not all food is equal. and that’s why we want to go to the basics. </p>
            <p>

                We want people not only to value their food but also to KNOW their food, know that maybe?? it’s not dangerous even though the smell is a little bit off, or maybe it is! The best way to learn is through experience. To really know your food you need the experience. But sometimes it can be a little scary to jump into the deep end. We are here to provide the valuable information you need. Let us be the guiding hand through the process. </p>
